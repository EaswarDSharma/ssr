we first generate html of all components, by renderer
since src/index.js is ran on webpack we can use es6
public/bundle.js to pass with html. so we pass html with js for event handling etc. this has axios instance store with an initial state? rerenders with routes
"React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup."~doc
first sent html has id root. we search this in client.js, rerender with the routes which has some data n js
in index.js req,store ,null obj r passed to html returning renderer.js in which storehandled by provider , routes n obj handled by staticRoutes 
this store is passed with html after serializing
routes
routes are shared with clientn server
null obj context for error handling and redirects
browser router has access to browser, so knows path.
staticRouter needs props for location=rep.path
index.js has "*" path for all route handling
index.js get * 


config files
base.js test files end with .js with baber-loader, excluding node_modules. preset react for jsx to js, stage-0 for async code
client.js make file with filename in path. aims cient.js to bundle.js in public
server.js uses node on src/index.js to get bundel.js in build(private)  excludes internal package node_modules

src/helpers
createStore exports store with null obj, allowing reducers to change it, create custon axios instance for server side
